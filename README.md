High Potential HR Service Leads Prediction

Approach Overview

This project focuses on predicting high-potential HR service leads using company funding and hiring trends.
The approach consists of multiple steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values.
Dropped unnecessary columns such as company_id, company_name, industry, last_funding_date, and hiring_roles.
Handled missing values by filling them with the median or most frequent values, depending on the feature type.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure better model performance.

2. Feature Engineering

Selected relevant features that contribute to the prediction of high-potential leads
Created new meaningful features based on funding rounds and hiring activity trends.
Removed highly correlated features to avoid multicollinearity issues.

3. Model Selection & Training

Chose RandomForestClassifier as the primary model due to its robustness and ability to handle both categorical and numerical features effectively.
Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.
Trained the model on the training dataset and optimized hyperparameters using cross-validation.
Evaluated model performance on the test set using classification metrics.

4. Model Evaluation

Used classification_report to assess model performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
Plotted a confusion matrix to visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Calculated cross_val_score to validate the modelâ€™s generalization ability across different data splits.

5. Making Predictions on Test Data

Preprocessed the test dataset in the same way as the training data.
Applied StandardScaler to standardize numerical features.
Used the trained RandomForestClassifier to predict the probabilities of high-potential leads.
Convetted probabilities into binary classifications using a 0.5 threshold.
Saved the final predictions as a CSV file for submission.

6. Output File

The final predictions are stored in predictions.csv, containing the company_id and the predicted is_hot_lead value (1 for high-potential leads, 0 for others).

7. Summary

This approach ensures a well-structured machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and final predictions.
The use of feature engineering, cross-validation, and performance metrics helped improve the reliability of the predictions.

8.Future Improvements

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize Random Forest hyperparameters for better performance.
Deep Learning Approach: Experiment with neural networks for improved accuracy.
More Data Sources: Incorporate external financial and hiring trend data for richer insights.
Automated Pipeline: Build an end-to-end pipeline for real-time predictions.
